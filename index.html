                <p style="font-weight: bold;">A trustworthy website for women seeking for change</p>
                <p>The artil's readers have a curious and conscious mind. They are fed up with today’s society and the lack of action by world leaders and the established system. They want to see change on a larger scale and they find value in being part of that change. The new website aims to help them find fresh and ballsy content as artil isn't afraid of talking loud about anything. This is their new place to get inspired, get knowledge, get involved and get entertained.</p>

                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Fresh and inspiring design to communicate direct and clear message</p>
                <p>Artil developed its visual identity mostly through social media. It's color palette includes a mix of cold greys, warm browns and off-black colors which gives a sophisticated, professional and modern vibe with a pinch of honest and warm feeling at the same time. Additionally, using a mix of elegant serfi Abril font family and sans serif Lato with semi-rounded details perfectly combine each other. My role was to appropriately implement it on the website so it gives the same kind of feeling.</p>

                <p>The secret to viral growth on Instagram right now? Yes, Instagram Reels. With a good Reel Strategy, I strived to flex my creative muscles and add a visual experience beyond a grid post. One of many examples could be Reels for Beauty Products Campaign which appear simultaneously with articles written by one of my colleagues on the blog.</p>

                <p>Instagram carousels allow you to share several photos and/or graphics all in one post. During Pride Week Campaign for artil I made a carousel post about ignorance towards LGBTQ+ Community. It was a great way to add depth to the feed but also share valuable content without spamming followers.<br>
                    Instead of sharing a single photo, I focused on telling a story, combining valuable text with engaging graphics, still keeping the aesthetics and style of artil.</p>

                <p>Every farmer participating in the Arlagården Plus programme, has to enter sustainability data regarding his farm. Sounds boring already? Well, the sustainable survey consists of 100 questions which have to be filled out 4 times per year. Quite a lot, when you have hundreds of cows to milk.
                    How to motivate them to fill the survey and save their time and money? New Arlagården Plus farmer's dashboard is a solution for that - user-friendly, easy to navigate and functional tool that gives them help towards a carbon-free planet.</p>

                <h4><span>Problem</span></h4>
                <p>Data entry is generally boring and creating an interesting survey is a challenge in itself. Combining this with the fact that Arla farmers are busy people with a business to run, doesn’t make it easier. Filling out one hundred questions survey every third month, takes away from their valuable time. So why is it even worth it? Besides the extra cent per kg milk we also believe that farmers genuinely want to make the planet a better place. They make a living off the land and, being very family oriented, they also want to leave healthy earth for their grandchildren.</p>
                <p class="problem-statement">How can we provide Arla's farmers with a fast and easy to use platform that will motivate them to fill the sustainable survey and track their progress?</p>

                <p>The answer for the problem was a dashboard where farmers can access via logging into a personal profile. The platform includes the sustainable survey, feature to track the progress, calculate the extra money and educate about sustainable farming. </p>

                <p>The survey is enough confusing, so the goal was to provide farmers with clear, simple but still engaging interface, The key point was to minimise noise, maintain engagement and prioritise the sustainable survey with progres tracking:<br>

                <p>Not always features and improvements that designers are excited about benefit the users. Usability testing was crucial to discover flaws of the functionalities or problems with navigating the platform. 
                    Surprisingly, extra features like weather forecasts don't matter so much for the milk farmers. But by removing it I could focus on some more important elements.</p>

                <p>It’s more crucial than ever before, that we all take responsibility for the planet we’re living on. Farmers especially carry a huge weight on their shoulders, and although often faced with a lot of criticism, they actually work hard to reduce their environmental impact. Arlagården Plus is a program which ensures that the milk is being produced in an environmentally conscious way, and that the animals are happy and healthy. 
                    Now, with user-friendly, intuitive dashboard that would assist farmers in their daily lives, they can keep an eye on their progress, educate about environmental impact that the farming has and improve they journey towards more sustainable and nature-friendly farm.</p>

                <p class="project-qualities">UI/UX / WEB-APP / Development</p>
                <p>We currently live in a linear economy where we take resources from the earth and
                    then dump them in a giant hole in the ground. One-third of food produced for
                    human consumption is wasted or lost globally. The saddest part is that we have
                    enough food to feed everyone on the planet, but most of it is wasted or lost. But
                    the top of the iceberg is that food waste has a terrific impact on the whole planet -
                    land or water abuse, CO2 production, pollution, or energy usage.</p>

                    <h4><span>Problem</span></h4>
                    <p>There is a fair amount of actions we, as a society, can take to make a positive difference. To better understand the problem and how to solve it through the digital solution, I first asked myself a question:</p>
                    <p class="problem-statement">How can our digital solution motivate and guide our users in reducing food waste?</p>

                <h4><span>How it works</span></h4>
                <p>The main purpose of the app is to help consumers fight against food waste in their households. Therefore, the main feature is buying and/or selling ripe of close-to-expiration date products that others can use.<br>
                    <span style="line-height: 1.4;">
                        <span class="dot">&#8226;</span>You can create a post with details about the food product you want to sell (name, description, category, and time to pick-up); after that, the post is available for the others.<br>
                        <span class="dot">&#8226;</span>On the main feed, you can browse the food products (posts), filter through them, or use a search bar.<br>
                        <span class="dot">&#8226;</span>If you notice a food item that you’re interested in - you get into the post, choose available time slots, and make the payment; then the notification goes to the seller and you receive more details where to pick up the food.<br>
                        <span class="dot">&#8226;</span>All posts that you’ve been interacting with, are available in the profile, where you can see details of created and purchased foods.

                <h2>HUSKØBET</h2>
                <p class="project-qualities">INTERNSHIP PROJECT / UI/UX / DASHBOARD</p>
                <p>Buying a house, renovating or building can be quiet complex. Each time it's associated with a large investment and many considerations that sometimes require expert's help. Lots of documentation, going back and forth from one office to another adds extra complexity to the whole process. Together with Huskøbet, we built a solution for that problem: user's dashboard that enables members to easily get professional help within law, finances, insurance or construction to make the house journey smooth and even enjoyable.</p>

                <h4><span>Problem</span></h4>
                <p class="problem-statement">How through digital solution can I help Huskøbet’s members handle the house journey and improve experience with processing the services?</p>
                <p>Huskøbet is a member club, which provides its members with network of independent advisors, knowledge universe and services that helps in house buying, renovating or building. But being a member club, the company doesn't have a reliable place for its members. The place where they can keep their data, upload necessary documents and get help from advisors and experts from the field. House journey is a complex process, paper work, lots of spent money and worries. Many users struggle with vocabulary of the house buying industry and need a tool which helps them gather everything in one place.</p>

            <div class="description-paragraph">
                <h4><span>Solution</span></h4>
                <p>We can all agree that one of the best solutions for displaying and organising information, tracking the data and providing the user with clear and easy to digest overview of information is dashboard. That was my plan for this project: to design an easy-to-navigate dashboard that is user-friendly, functional and nice-looking tool for Huskøbet's members.</p>

                <h4><span>PROCESS</span></h4>
                <p>I divided my work into three main stages:<br><br>
                    <span>&#8226;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">research and analysis</span> which involves interviewing the stakeholders, business analysis and defining the target audience, understanding their behaviors by empathy map and mapping user's experience with user journey,<br>
                    <span>&#8226;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">design</span> where I run competitive analysis, defined the style for my solution, wireframed my ideas and then prototyped the mock-ups, as my next stage was...<br>
                    <span>&#8226;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">...usability testing</span> that I run using clickable prototype to reveal any pitfalls and ensure that the product is easily accessible and can help reduce users' pains and fulfil their needs.</p>

                <h4><span>DESIGN REVIEW</span></h4>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Communicating the values through visuals</p>
                <p>Huskøbet has developed it's visual identity through digital platforms, like website, social media or advertising. The company uses its recognisable blue color scheme, which triggers feeling like loyalty, trust, knowledge, seriousness and stability. I aimed to trigger the same feeling through my solution, playing with colors, soft shadows and rounded corners. Applying design principles, like proximity, symmetry or similarity I wanted to make the design more aesthetically pleasing and better communicate the values through visuals.</p>

                <h4><span>IDEATION</span></h4>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">A safe family life, requires the right housing choices</p>
                <p>Buying, building or renovating a house was never easy. Even when we constantly developing and technology provides us with the latest improvements, there are still areas that we can handle overselves. My goal was to come up with a intuitive, user-friendly and modern tool that with its simple intercase, functionalities and good-looking design can help the Huskøbet 's members handle any house issue and take them closer to the HOME of their dreams.</p>

                <h4><span>HOW IT WORKS</span></h4>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">From a booked service to the open case</p>
                <p>Having registered to the member club, user has now access to his personal dashboard. From now on he has access to his cases, benefits of the member club and personal data. But wait, could you explain what are the 'cases'?<br><br>
                    The user starts his house journey by booking a service from variety of choices. When he makes 'an order' he is directly taken to the dashboard when the 'new case' starts. In the new case user works with the assigned advisor on the chosen service that could be a sketch drawing with architect or ownership insurance with bank advisor.<br><br>
                Think of it as a web-shop. You go to the services list (product page), make an order ('buy' a product) and go to the basket (dashboard).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="description-paragraph">
                <h4><span>MOBILE RESPONSIVE</span></h4>
                <p>Mobile responsive isn't an option anymore. As these small devices constantly assist us in our daily lives it essential to design a mobile-friendly interface. 70% of Huskobet's users are active phone users so it was crucial to have the solution responsive for smaller screen sizes.</p>

                <h4><span>FINAL THOUGHTS</span></h4>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Learning by doing</p>
                <p>Beginnings are always hard because we see the huge amount of work it takes to finish. And when we finally start, the reality kicks in. Lots of brainstormings, rethinking, fighting with your own thoughts, not being sure if what you're doing goes in the right direction. We suddenly realise what a milestone it is to finish what we've already started. But in the end, reaching the last pages it's a blissful moment full of pride and fulfilment.<br><br>
                    I have to say that until now it was the biggest individual project I've ever taken on my shoulders. Adding a short period of time and a big scope of the project, I can truly admit that I gained lots of experience, knowledge and skills that help me develop as a young multimedia designer.</p>
